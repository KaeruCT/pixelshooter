### pixelshooter

is a java shmup (shoot 'em up) made for fun

I like shmups and i've always wondered how everything in them works so
I decided to try and code one.

I'm using the [jgame framework](http://www.13thmonkey.org/~boris/jgame/)

The graphics aren't anything special, they're all made by me, which is why
they might not seem very good.

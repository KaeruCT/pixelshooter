# pixelshooter

pixelshooter is a java shmup (shoot 'em up) made for fun.

I like shmups and i've always wondered how everything in them works so
I decided to try and code one.

I'm using the [jgame framework](http://www.13thmonkey.org/~boris/jgame/)

The graphics aren't anything special, they're all made by me, which is why
they might not seem very good.

[Download the runnable JAR and try it out!](https://kaeruct.github.io/legacy-projects/pixelshooter/pixelshooter.jar)

# Android version

If you prefer to try this out on your mobile phone, [there is a newer and improved version for Android](https://github.com/KaeruCT/RaumBaller).

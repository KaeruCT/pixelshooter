###pixelshooter is a java shmup made for fun
I like shmups and i've always wondered how everything in them works so
I decided to try and code one.

I'm using the [jgame framework](http://www.13thmonkey.org/~boris/jgame/)

The graphics aren't anything special, they're all made by me, which is why
they might not seem very good.

[Download the runnable JAR and try it out!](https://github.com/KaeruCT/pixelshooter/blob/master/pixelshooter.jar?raw=true)
